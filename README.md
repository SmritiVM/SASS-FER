# SASS-FER

The goal of this project is to create a tool that could be used to identify a subject's emotions through their eye movement, lip profile and other facial cues.

Weâ€™ll work on two types of emotion representation systems:

1. Discrete Categories: image input 
2. Continuous Dimensions: video input, which aims to determine the emotion of the person by analyzing various dimensions.
